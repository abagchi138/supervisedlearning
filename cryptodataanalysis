Based on what I found I was able to successfully cluster the cryptocurrency data together. 
Using that we were able to successfully identify the number of clusters and we were able to get up to at least 5 clusters to figure out how specific cryptocurrencies can be put together.
The recomendation that I have is that to have no more than 5 clusters of cryptos together in order to identify the best comparison for it.
